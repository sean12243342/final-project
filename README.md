Welcome to the Puzzle game I have made.

It is way less hard and in reality a fraction of what I wanted to do but thats okay.

In this game you will try and get hints by inputing numbers on a range of possible numbers and then guess the answer to each puzzle. Once you finish all three puzzles and the bonus guessing game you win!

The player class is the base class which holds the list of useable items to help you, the basic player info, and the getters and setters for your gameplay.

The item class hosts the items and how they work in helping you play.

The baseworld is the only current world which features 3 puzzles for you to solve and a array based guessing game. It also has the intro to the world so you know how things work.

The main class holds the gameplay loop the decides how you play and if you win. 

There is so much more I wish I added (Including a real way to lose) but I wasted time a lot so I missed the mark on what I wanted to do. I would love to come back to this sometime but we will see.
